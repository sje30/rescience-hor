  abstract = "Most types of retinal neurons are spatially positioned in
              non-random patterns, termed retinal mosaics. Several
              developmental mechanisms are thought to be important in the
              formation of these mosaics. Most evidence to date suggests that
              homotypic constraints within a type of neuron are dominant, and
              that heterotypic interactions between different types of neuron
              are rare. In an analysis of macaque H1 and H2 horizontal cell
              mosaics, W{\"a}ssle et al. (2000) suggested that the high
              regularity index of the combined H1 and H2 mosaic might be caused
              by heterotypic interactions during development. Here we use
              computer modeling to suggest that the high regularity index of
              the combined H1 and H2 mosaic is a by-product of the basic
              constraint that two neurons cannot occupy the same space. The
              spatial arrangement of type A and type B horizontal cells in cat
              retina also follow this same principle.",

  author   = "W{\"a}ssle, H and Peichl, L and Boycott, B B",
  abstract = "Neurofibrillar methods stain a class of horizontal cells in the
              cat retina which are shown to be identical with the A-type
              horizontal cell of Golgi-staining. Thus all of the A-type cells
              of a single retina can be observed. On this basis the changes in
              density and dendritic field size of A-type horizontal cells with
              respect to retinal eccentricity were measured. The decrease in
              density from centre to periphery is balanced by a corresponding
              increase in size of the dendritic field. Consequently each
              retinal point--independent of retinal position--is covered by the
              dendritic fields of three of four A-type horizontal cells. The
              nuclei and nucleoli of B-type horizontal cells could also be
              recognized in neurofibrillar-stained material and thus their
              distribution was determined. The density ratio B-type: A-type is
              2.8 +/- 0.4 and does not vary much from the centre to the
              periphery of the retina. Each retinal point is also covered by
              four B-type horizontal cells. Thus a single cone can contact a
              maximum of eight horizontal cells. The rate of density decrease
              from centre to periphery is closely similar in cones and
              horizontal cells but greater in ganglion cells.",

  abstract = "To further characterize the H1 and H2 horizontal cell populations
              in macaque monkey retinae, cells were injected with the tracer
              Neurobiotin following intracellular recordings. Tracer coupling
              between cells of the same type revealed all H1 or H2 cells in
              small patches around the injected cell. The mosaics of their cell
              bodies and the tiling of the retina with their dendrites were
              analyzed. Morphological differences between the H1 and H2 cells
              observable in Neurobiotin-labeled patches made it possible to
              recognize H1 and H2 cells in retinae immunolabeled for the
              calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin and calbindin, and thus to
              study their relative spatial densities across the retina. These
              data, together with the intracellularly stained patches, show
              that H1 cells outnumber H2 cells at all eccentricities. There is,
              however, a change in the relative proportions of H1 and H2 cells
              with eccentricity: close to the fovea the ratio of H1 to H2 cells
              is approximately 4 to 1, in midperipheral retina approximately 3
              to 1, and in peripheral retina approximately 2 to 1. In both the
              Neurobiotin-stained and the immunostained retinae, about 3-5\% of
              the H2 cells were obviously misplaced into the ganglion cell
              layer. Several features of the morphology of the misplaced H2
              cells suggest that they represent the so-called ``biplexiform
              ganglion cells'' previously described in Golgi studies of primate
              retina.",
