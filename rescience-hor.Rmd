# Historical context

## Scientific question

To investigate a problem in neurobiology concerning the relative
spatial positioning of two types of neuron in the retina.  We used
three example datasets (pretty much all that was available at the
time) to investigate this problem using spatial statistics and
simulations of spatial patterning.  

## Computational context

Most of the code required for the 2008 paper had been developed by
myself since about 2000 working on other related problems.  The major
innovation here was in the biological problem.

## Original source code

> About the original source code: Was it published? Was it archived
> somewhere? Was there a license for it?

No, the source code was kept just on my hard drive.  I keep good
backups though, and in this case the projects were still in my home
directory (copied from machine to machine over the years).  No license
was written systematically to cover the code I wrote, although the R
packages are usually released under GPL or MIT.

## Retrieval of the software

This was relatively straightforward, as the software was all on my
harddrive.  As I wanted to make the code all public, not only the code
relating to this project was hosted on github, but I also decided to
release the underlying R packages I had written.
