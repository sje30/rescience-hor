# Rescience project

This is the home page for the Rescience 10-year reproduction
challenge, where I took one of my earlier papers (Eglen & Wong 2008)
and reproduced it 12 (and now 13) years later.  The details of the
Rescience paper should be available via: https://github.com/ReScience/submissions/issues/34

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sje30/rescience-hor/master?urlpath=rstudio)

To regenerate the project, start Binder above, and then when the
Rstudio sessions starts, in the console type:

```
system("make")
```

and then in the Files tab (bottom right of Rstudio), you can then open
the file `rescience-hor.pdf`.



## Note for the Rescience editors

The [article](template/article.pdf) and 
[metadata](template/metadata.yaml) are provided in the template folder.
