# Rescience project


[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sje30/rescience-hor/master?urlpath=rstudio)

To regenerate the project, start Binder above, and then when the
Rstudio sessions starts, in the console type:

```
system("make")
```

and then in the Files tab (bottom right of Rstudio), you can then open
the file `rescience-hor.pdf`.



## Note for the Rescience editors

I have used your template to create a cover page for my submission,
following the yaml file.  I did not yet attempt how to generate a pdf
from Rmd using your templates.  My
[article](template-master/article2.pdf) with
[metadata](template-master/metadata.yaml) are in the template-master folder.
