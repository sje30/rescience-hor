# Rescience project


[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sje30/rescience-hor/master?urlpath=rstudio)

To regenerate the project, start Binder above, and then when the
Rstudio sessions starts, in the console type:

```
system("make")
```

and then in the Files tab (bottom right of Rstudio), you can then open
the file `rescience-hor.pdf`.
